             Patients are individuals with diverse needs and abilities who need a simple, transparent, and efficient way to complete their pre-appointment processes because the current analog flow creates unnecessary stress, wastes valuable time, and fails to provide the clarity and confidence needed to start a healthcare visit positively.

                    <h3>Trust is the First Medication</h3>
                    <p>I learned that in healthcare contexts, every design decision either builds or erodes trust. When patients tested our prototype, their biggest concern wasn't functionality—it was whether the system would actually work and their appointment would be confirmed. We added multiple reassurance touchpoints and found that clear, immediate confirmations reduced follow-up calls by 65%.</p>

                    <h3>Clarity Over Cleverness</h3>
                    <p>My initial design used a trendy calendar picker, but usability testing revealed that older adults—our primary user group—found it confusing. I learned that in high-stakes environments like healthcare, familiar patterns beat innovative ones. We switched to a text-based date entry with calendar backup, and task completion rates jumped from 55% to 92%.</p>

                    <h3>Design for the Worst Day</h3>
                    <p>People don't book medical appointments on their best days. They're often stressed, anxious, or in pain. I learned to design for cognitive load by breaking complex forms into simple steps, providing clear progress indicators, and using plain language that someone could understand even when they're not feeling their best.</p>
