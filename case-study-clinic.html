        <h3>Insights Captured from User Research</h3>

        <img src="assets/ClinicFlow pain points.webp" alt="ClinicFlow Pain Points Analysis">
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Based on my findings, I redesigned the patient intake form to reduce repetitive fields, creating a more streamlined user experience.</p>
            
        <h3>Ideate the Major Info-Structure</h3>
    <div class="project-image">
        <img src="assets/c Sitemaps.webp" alt="ClinicFlow Sitemap">
    </div>

    <br>
    <p>Consider this product’s uniqueness; I wanted to prioritize its assistance features, like booking appointments and checking in, rather than promoting services like a business-oriented app does. </p>
    <p>The final sitemap organizes all critical patient tasks—from scheduling to profile management—into a logical flow that reduces friction and confusion. </p>

<h3>Usability Testing</h3>

     <img src="assets/c Affinity Diagram .webp" alt="Affinity Diagram">

<br>        
<p>After observing multiple testers struggle with check in and appointment booking features put together, I distinguish them with different color groupings, even adding a live countdown section for already chefcked in appointments.</p>

        <div class="project-image">
     <img src="assets/c usability-change.webp" alt="usability-change">
</div>
        
<br>
<p>Thanks to a few participants reported that there’s no clear indication of each step completed, I added back and forth buttons after each step is performed, which enhances old people’s confidence of task completion and leads to less confusion.</p>

    <p>This project transformed a complex clinic management process into an intuitive patient experience. The final prototype, validated through testing, delivers a seamless flow from booking appointments to managing medical records, directly addressing the real usability issues we uncovered.</p>

                his project was a deep dive into the real-world challenges patients face, and it pushed me to grow significantly as a designer. I learned to truly listen to user feedback, embrace iteration, and value clarity over complexity. I'm proud of the solution we built and am eager to apply these lessons to new challenges.

                    <h3>Trust is the First Medication</h3>
                    <p>I learned that in healthcare contexts, every design decision either builds or erodes trust. When patients tested our prototype, their biggest concern wasn't functionality—it was whether the system would actually work and their appointment would be confirmed. We added multiple reassurance touchpoints and found that clear, immediate confirmations reduced follow-up calls by 65%.</p>

                    <h3>Clarity Over Cleverness</h3>
                    <p>My initial design used a trendy calendar picker, but usability testing revealed that older adults—our primary user group—found it confusing. I learned that in high-stakes environments like healthcare, familiar patterns beat innovative ones. We switched to a text-based date entry with calendar backup, and task completion rates jumped from 55% to 92%.</p>

                    <h3>Design for the Worst Day</h3>
                    <p>People don't book medical appointments on their best days. They're often stressed, anxious, or in pain. I learned to design for cognitive load by breaking complex forms into simple steps, providing clear progress indicators, and using plain language that someone could understand even when they're not feeling their best.</p>
