                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    I never set out to become a UX designer—I started by building things people needed. When I launched <strong>Lan Studio</strong>, I spent countless hours talking to customers, learning that the difference between a good product and a great one often comes down to understanding the small, unspoken frustrations people experience.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    At <strong>Erovenus</strong>, I discovered the power of listening beyond the data. Hosting candid conversations with our community taught me that the most valuable insights often come from understanding not just what people do, but why they do it. I learned to translate those nuanced human behaviors into product decisions that actually moved business metrics.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    The <strong>Google UX Program</strong> gave me the framework to formalize what I'd learned through trial and error. Now I approach every project with that same entrepreneurial mindset—asking not just "is this usable?" but "does this solve a real problem for real people in a way that makes business sense?" Because at the end of the day, great design isn't just about beautiful interfaces; it's about creating value for both users and the business.

                <h4>For UX Leaders & Teams</h4>
                <p>I bridge the gap between research and execution. I don't just deliver screens—I deliver insights grounded in real user behavior and business context. Having built products from scratch, I understand how design decisions impact development timelines and technical constraints.</p>

            <div class="persona-card">
                <h4>For Business Leaders</h4>
                <p>I approach design as a business function. My background in entrepreneurship means I'm always thinking about ROI, market fit, and how design drives growth. I speak the language of metrics and can articulate how user experience investments translate to business outcomes.</p>
