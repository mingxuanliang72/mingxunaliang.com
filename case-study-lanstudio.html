            Lan Studio began as a simple question: <strong>why do people form emotional connections with certain products?</strong> I started by selling handmade home decor at local markets, spending weekends not just making sales, but having conversations. I learned that customers weren't buying products—they were buying stories, craftsmanship, and the promise of a home that felt more like <em>them</em>.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
            As the business grew from market stalls to e-commerce, I became the entire product team: researcher, designer, and business strategist. Every customer complaint became a usability study. Every return was a failed user journey. Every five-star review revealed what actually resonated with people. I wasn't just A/B testing buttons—I was testing business hypotheses in real time with real money on the line.

                "The home decor market was saturated with generic products, while customers increasingly sought authentic, story-driven brands.

                    <h3>Customer Development is Everything</h3>
                    <p>I learned to treat every customer interaction as qualitative research. The woman who spent 20 minutes explaining why she chose a specific ceramic vase taught me more about our value proposition than any survey could. This taught me that the best insights often come from listening to what people do, not just what they say.</p>

                    <h3>Design Decisions Have Real Business Consequences</h3>
                    <p>When I simplified the product photography to show items in realistic home settings (instead of perfect studio shots), conversion rates increased by 30%. This wasn't just a design preference—it was a business decision that directly impacted revenue. I learned to make design choices based on business outcomes, not just aesthetics.</p>

                    <h3>Building Beats Theorizing</h3>
                    <p>I stopped guessing what customers wanted and started building minimum viable products. The fastest way to validate an idea wasn't another focus group—it was putting a prototype in front of real customers and seeing if they'd actually pay for it. This 'build-measure-learn' mentality became my default approach to product development.</p>

                <p>I understand the full product lifecycle because I've lived it. From initial concept to manufacturing to customer support, I've seen how early design decisions compound over time. I don't just design screens—I design business outcomes.</p>

                <h4>For UX Teams</h4>
                <p>I bring an entrepreneurial mindset to design problems. I'm constantly asking "what's the business hypothesis behind this feature?" and "how will we know if this design is successful?" I bridge the gap between user needs and business constraints.</p>

    <!-- Reflection -->

        <h2>Reflection: From Founder to UX Strategist</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
            Lan Studio taught me that the most successful products aren't just usable—they're <strong>meaningful</strong>. They solve real problems for real people in ways that make business sense. While I loved building my own brand, I discovered my true passion lies in applying this user-centered, business-minded approach to help other companies create products that customers love and that drive sustainable growth.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
            Today, when I approach a new UX challenge, I bring that founder mentality: resourceful, metrics-driven, and relentlessly focused on creating value for both users and the business. Because at the end of the day, great design isn't just about beautiful interfaces—it's about building things that matter to people and that work in the real world.
